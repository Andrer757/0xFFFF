Fiasco firmware pieces
======================

The firmware for the maemo devices is composed by a set of pieces containing
the required parts to update the whole system following a partition layout
defined by NOLO on the internal flash memory.

Nokia provides a blob packed with a proprietary format called 'FIASCO'. This
blob contains the following pieces:

 - omap-nand   -  only flashable via serial jtag
 - xloader     -  first part of nolo
 - secondary   -  second part of nolo (usb support and launches kernel)
 - kernel      -  the kernel
 - initfs      -  initial system that initializes everything and runs rootfs
 - rootfs      -  the whole system image

Some of these pieces are versioned to match board specific features
(mostly xloader and secondary ones).

This format is not supported by 0xFFFF at this moment, but there are no
plans for doing it in short term. This is because we only need to flash
separated pieces. We can just distribute tarballs containing the pieces
and meta information with a whole Free OS for the internet tablets.

To flash an initfs partition and reboot:

  $ 0xFFFF -p initfs%initfs.jffs2 -R

The format of the argument is [piece-type] % [file-name] (% [version-string]).

Pieces can be automatically identified by using the '-I' flag:

  $ 0xFFFF -I initfs.jffs2
  initfs.jffs2: initfs

You can dump these pieces from the internal memory of the internet
tablet by using the mtd-utils over /dev/mtd* or just running:

  770$ 0xFFFF -e /media/mmc1

There is another way for dumping pieces with extra parameters and options,
read doc/dumping for more information.
