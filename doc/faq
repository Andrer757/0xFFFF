<h2>FAQ</h2>

<b>*) How can I set my Internet Tablet into RD mode with 0xFFFF?</b>

  Just type '0xFFFF -r 1' as root


<b>*) How can I unpack a FIASCO firmware?

  Just type '0xFFFF -r 1' as root


<b>*) How can I unpack a FIASCO firmware?</b>

  Just type '0xFFFF -u FiascoFirmware.bin -e /tmp' as root


<b>*) How can I flash a new rootfs?

  Unpack the pieces from the fiasco firmware (the one distributed by Nokia for example) and then type:

  # 0xFFFF -R -p rootfs.jffs 


<b>*) How can I flash a full FIASCO image?</b>

  It is not recommended to use, it needs more testing, and is more secure to unpack them first manually
  and flash the pieces manually with multiple '-p' flags. If you are brave try:

  # 0xFFFF -F FiascoFirmware.fiasco


<h2>Advanced commands</h2>

<b>*) How to extract the firmware pieces from a running device?</b>

  It is possible to dump the firmware pieces from the internal MTD to reconstruct a FIASCO image.
  To do this recompile the flasher for ARM and run this command in the device:

  # mkdir /media/mmc1/backup
  # 0xFFFF -e /media/mmc1/backup


<b>*) Dumping configuration region</b>

  There's a hidden mtd partition containing undocumented configuration information. This one can be
  dumped from the device using the following command:

  # 0xFFFF -x
