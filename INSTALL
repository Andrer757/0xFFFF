Installation instructions:
==========================

To build the flasher you will need gcc, make and libusb. For crosscompiling
to arm you can use scratchbox. But you will probably need the libusb.so of
the scratchbox environment to the device.

Just type:

  $ make

The installation procedure is quite simple and you can define a new PREFIX
manually from the command line:

  $ make install PREFIX=/usr

The default one is /usr/local (not very userfriendly but standards are
standards :P hehe)
