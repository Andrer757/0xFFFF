Installation instructions:
==========================

To build the flasher you will need gcc, make and libusb. For crosscompiling
to arm you can use scratchbox. But you will probably need the libusb.so of
the scratchbox environment to the device.

Just type:

  $ make

The most interesting targets for make are:

  all        normal build
  allusb     builds 0xFFFF without libusb dependency (embedded)
  static     builds 0xFFFF statically (no need for libusb)

  install    installs into /usr/local by default

  clean      clean compilation objects and generated binaries


The installation procedure is quite simple and you can define a new PREFIX
manually from the command line:

  $ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

The default one is /usr/local (not very userfriendly but standards are
standards :P hehe)
